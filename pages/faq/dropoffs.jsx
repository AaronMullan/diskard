We encourage them to understand that our AI is best-in-class and is able to deliver the right debris for the situation, regardless of if the member is currently aware of their own garbage needs. Fortunately, members experience frequent upgrades, so you probably will not wait long to find a unseaworthy speedboat or the charred remains of a stolen Toyota Tercel ditched unceremoniously on your property. Members who report such incidents to the authorities are automatically upgraded to our Snitches get Stitches VIP club."
